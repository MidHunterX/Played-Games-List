# Played Games List
This is a webpage for keeping a list of all the PC games that I have finished playing. <br>
The main purpose of this beginner project is to re-familiarize :

- [x] **Grouping and structuring source directory**
<br> `Proper dir structure... this is the way`
- [x] **Structuring an HTML more effectively by utilizing JavaScript**
<br> `JS can be used to render recurring HTML using a loop soo...`
<br> `Less code = less work? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
<br> `Probably not.`
- [x] **Connecting a database to webpage**
<br> `JSON can be read using D3, JQuery, Fetch etc.`
<br> `Chose JSON because... no API calls, no login nothing.`
<br> `Perfect fit for my laziness.`
- [x] **Style elements using CSS**
<br> `Yep, no external libraries.`
<br> `No bootstrap. Going the long ugly route.`

and to keep track of all the games that i have played as well.
